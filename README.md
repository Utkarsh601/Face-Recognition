# Face Recognition App ðŸ‘€

This is a simple **Face Recognition App** built with **Python**, **OpenCV**, and **Streamlit**. The application uses Haarcascade classifiers to detect faces and eyes from an image or webcam feed.

## Features
- Face Detection using Haarcascade Classifier.
- Eye Detection using Haarcascade Classifier.
- Real-time video feed processing.
- Easy-to-use web interface built with **Streamlit**.
- Deployed on **Streamlit Cloud (share.streamlit.io)**.

## Demo
[Face Recognition App](https://face-recognition-project.streamlit.app/)

## Technologies Used
- **Python** - Programming language used for building the app.
- **OpenCV** - Library for image processing and computer vision tasks.
- **Streamlit** - Framework for creating web interfaces quickly and easily.
